# Modern OpenGL Samples

Here I have some modern opengl studies. Initially all code here targets OpenGL 3.3 core profile. All code is in C, and I purposely tried to create  as few functions and files as possible, to make it easier to read and understand all steps necessary to execute the proposed task.

When the programs start to became more complicated, I'll split it in more self contained functions.
